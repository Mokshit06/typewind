## Custom Config File Path

If you're using monorepo or your tailwind config file is just in another folder, you can use this feature to change the path

You'll just need to add the following config to your `package.json` file.
```json
{
    "typewind": {
        "configPath": "./path/to/your/tailwind.config.cjs"
    }
}
```
