# Typewind

## Introduction

Typewind is a **typesafe** and **zero-runtime** version of Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

It was inspired by [Colin McDonnel](https://twitter.com/colinhacks)'s [tweet](https://twitter.com/colinhacks/status/1615154756204523521) on what tailwind with type safety and proper autocompletion would look like.

<div className="flex justify-center mt-5">
  <Tweet />
</div>

## Tailwind CSS

Typewind is built on top of Tailwind CSS. For more information on Tailwind CSS, please visit their [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
