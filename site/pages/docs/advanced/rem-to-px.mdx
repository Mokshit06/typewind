title: Rem to Px
---

## Custom Config File Path

In the hover docs for the typewind classes, you can choose to see the `px` equivalents of the `rem` values set by Tailwind by adding the following.

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "typewind": {
    "showPixelEquivalents": true,
    "rootFontSize": 18
  }
}
```

By default, `showPixelEquivalents` is false and `rootFontSize` is 16 (which is the standard value, unless reset by the user).
